# PAT.AI_Hackathon
Authors: Faizanm0903, Benicom 

Our project targets the topics of Artificial Intelligence and Productivity. We designed a task-management platform using notion, that integrates python code to  convert speech
to text. Our project targets university students, to help them be more productive with all of their tasks. To activate PAT you must say “Hey PAT”. Pat will reply back to you 
with instructions, and you may proceed however you want. PAT will consider your Speech as input, adn output a series of words reflecting exactly what you said.
